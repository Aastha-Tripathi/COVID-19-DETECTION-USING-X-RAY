# COVID-19-DETECTION-USING-X-RAY
## ML MODEL : COVID-19 DETECTION USING X-RAY
## OBJECTIVE :
This is a *ML Model *where the user has to upload a Chest X-Ray. In the Back-End , our project uses Convolutional Neural Network and Keras for pattern detection in the Image and after matching the X-ray with the training data set, the user will be given a Report if he/she is Covid-19 positive or not.

## Datasets and Information:
We used Kaggle open source datasets from the following sources for 
training and testing our Machine Learning Model.
Dataset1 - https://www.kaggle.com/khoongweihao/covid19-xray-datasettrain-test-sets
Dataset2 - https://www.kaggle.com/bachrr/covid-chest-xray
